# Falabella-Technical-Assessment

Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for  multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Linio". For multiples of 5 print "IT". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "Linianos". But here's the catch: you can use only one `if`. No multiple branches, ternary operators or `else`.

Technical Details:
